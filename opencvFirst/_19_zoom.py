#Image Pyramids
# Image pyramids are a way to represent an image at multiple resolutions. They are useful in
# computer vision tasks such as image processing, object detection, and image recognition.
# In OpenCV, image pyramids can be created using the `pyrUp` and `pyrDown` functions.


# Note ðŸ‘‰  that when we reduce the size of an image, information of the image is lost. Once, we
# scale down and if we rescale it to the original size, we lose some information and the
# resolution of the new image is much lower than the original one.
